# After completing, player analysis and dealer schedule's analysis, I noted that the player behind the scam was Mylie Schmidt and the dealer was Billy Jones. 
Reasons for this finding:
	1) On the Losses occured on 0310,0312,0315 and other days 0311,0313,0314,0316,0317.
	2) Mylie Schmidt was the player who played occasionally.
	3) During Loss Time, he played 13 times and other days he played 26 times, overall, he played 39 times.
	4) Dealer was Billy Jones, because on loss date: 0310, 0312, 0315, Billy Jones was the only dealer at the roulette table.
